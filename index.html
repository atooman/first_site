            <img width="400px" src="/images/honey_main.jpeg" alt="Honey is a medium-sized golden retriever with honey brown fur. She has a white patch of fur on her chest and her right eye is smaller than her left">
            <p>Honeys favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the middle of January and half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my brother and I go underwater, she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we come up for air.</p>
            <p>While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase rocks. She will even chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face in the water to try and find the rock thrown. Chasing rocks is her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks from our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from home. Finally one other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in the middle of the night and found Honey is a bathtub</p>
